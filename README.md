# Philip Huang's Portfolio

# Description
Every professional needs a calling card and here is where I want to build mine.  Its hard to show off programming skills on a resume, and I have always found it hard to sell myself in person.  I am hoping that this portfolio page  will become my one stop shop for all things me.  I am hoping that this page will help sell myself for me so that people can see what I've done.  Right now, its pretty barebones with placeholder images and links to google, but one day I hope to fill it up with many programs that I will have created.  The main problem this page will solve is that it will create an online presence for myself, and a way for me to easily show off my skills.  In addition this page is way for me how to learn how to build pages in general and how to structure the html and css.  This is a project I will be revisiting over and over again as I learn more and create more projects, and I hope I can make it even better.

I hope you can click on my page and see my work for yourself.

# Example
My favorite thing about my page right now is the highlighting feature on the image links.  I just love the way it looks.
